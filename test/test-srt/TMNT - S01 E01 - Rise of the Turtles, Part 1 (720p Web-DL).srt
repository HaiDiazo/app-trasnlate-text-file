1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,825
- Yah!
- Oh, yeah!

2
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:53,232
Michelangelo is on the move!

3
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,138
Heeyah!

4
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:57,947
You don't know what to do.

5
00:00:57,948 --> 00:01:00,356
I'm here, I'm there.

6
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:01,930
I could be anywhere.

7
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:06,111
How do you stop what
you can't even see?

8
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,943
Like that?

9
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:17,484
Good one, Leo.

10
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:25,643
All right, Donnie.

11
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:28,420
Put down the staff and
no one gets hurt.

12
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,229
Uh, you said that last time,
Raph, and then you hurt me.

13
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,106
Yeah, but less
than I would have.

14
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:37,919
Yeah, right.

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,923
Wah!

16
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:40,761
Ah!

17
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:48,824
Yah!

18
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,451
Should've dropped the staff?

19
00:01:56,452 --> 00:02:00,564
Should've dropped the staff.

20
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:03,008
Okay, okay. Ow! I'm down!

21
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,803
<i>Onegai shimasu.</i>

22
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:12,943
Whatever you say.

23
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:21,669
Ah!

24
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:25,352
Agh!

25
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:50,905
Nice try.

26
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:51,906
<i>Ya me!</i>

27
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:04,418
You all did very well.

28
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,258
But I did better.

29
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,633
This is about
self-improvement, Raphael.

30
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:10,974
It is not about
winning and losing.

31
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:12,947
I know, sensei.

32
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,088
But I won and they lost.

33
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:16,593
Ah, ah, ah!

34
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:18,794
But what's really important
is that we all did our best.

35
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:19,971
Good job, everyone!

36
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,312

Bleh!

61
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:39,114
There's a little more
algae and worms left

62
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:40,886
if anyone wants it.

63
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:43,396
Anybody? Anybody?

64
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,734
- No, thanks.
- I'm good.

65
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,004
All yours.

66
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:48,914
Well, I guess no one
left room for... Cake!

67
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,788
<i>- Whoa!
- It is a cake!</i>

68
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:55,035
Made of... algae...
and... worms.

69
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:56,742
What's the frosting made out of?

70
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,380
You don't wanna know.

71
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,420
Happy Mutation day!

72
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,595
Happy Mutation day!

73
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:04,201
Ah, yes.

74
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:07,144
15 years ago today, our
lives changed forever

75
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,987
and we became the
unlikeliest of families.

76
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:12,194
Tell us the story,
Master Splinter.

77
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,272
Michelangelo, I have already
told it many times.

78
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,948
Please! Pleeeease!

79
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,025
Please. It's the only
way to shut Mikey up.

80
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:23,267
Ah, very well.

81
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:26,946
Many years ago, when
I was still human,

82
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:30,826
I was leaving the pet store
with four baby turtles.

83
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:33,000
- That was us?
- Yes.

84
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,538
Don't interrupt!

85
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,984
I passed a strange
man on the street.

86
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:42,366
Something felt off about him.

87
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,274
I decided to follow.

88
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:51,029
Go no further.

89
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,471
This place is a place
where you are not allowed

90
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:55,010
to be in this place.

91
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:57,451
We have been seen in
this place by you,

92
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,962
so this is not a place
that will be left by you.

93
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,501
That was the beginning
of our life together.

94
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:24,611
It was the mysterious
substance in this canister

95
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:27,689
that, in a way, gave
birth to us all.

96
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,692
Mom.

97
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,739
So, sensei, now that we're 15,

98
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,218
I think we're finally ready to
go up to the surface, don't you?

99
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,558
Yes.

100
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,634
And no.

101
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,037
- Oh, man, come on.
- Lame.

102
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:43,511
I hate when he does that.

103
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:46,119
You have grown powerful,
but you are still young.

104
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,263
You lack the maturity to
use your skills wisely.

105
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:52,675
So, sensei, isn't that just no?

106
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:54,247
Yes...

107
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,221
And no.

108
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:58,596
Wisdom comes from experience.

109
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:01,606
And experience comes
from making mistakes.

110
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:02,944
Aha!

111
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:04,851
So in order for us
to gain the wisdom,

112
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:06,757
we have to make the mistakes.

113
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,864
- So we can go.
- No.

114
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,838
- And yes?
- No!

115
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,839
Oh!

116
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:16,458
Sensei, we know you're
trying to protect us,

117
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:19,503
but we can't spend our whole
lives hiding down here.

118
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:29,434
Mm.

119
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:32,783
You may go tonight.

120
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:37,934
High three!

121
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,260
Mr. Crenshaw, status report!

122
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,535
Status? I'll give
you the status!

123
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,676
We're gonna blow
up in two seconds!

124
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:51,848
Thank you, captain.

125
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,723
Gentlemen, I have a
bold and daring plan.

126
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,262
There's no time for hesitation.

127
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:58,871
My orders must be carried
out without question!

128
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,042
Aye, sir!

129
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,372
You know this show
is stupid, right?

130
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:04,714
<i>Space Heroesis a great show.</i>

131
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:06,520
And captain Ryan
is a great hero.

132
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:09,463
Someday, I am gonna
be just like him.

133
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:11,771
Well, you do like to
hear yourself talk,

134
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:14,748
so you're on your way.

135
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,122
It's go time!

136
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,692
You are going up to a
strange and hostile world.

137
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,401
You must maintain
awareness at all times.

138
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:51,006
Aye, sensei!

139
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:53,849
- Stay in the shadows.
- Aye, sensei!

140
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,492
- Don't talk to strangers.
- Aye, sensei!

141
00:08:56,493 --> 00:09:00,473
- Everyone is a stranger.
- Aye, sensei!

142
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,680
Make sure you go
before you leave.

143
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:04,888
The restrooms up
there are filthy.

144
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,259
Sensei!

145
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,404
Good luck, my sons.

146
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:11,310
- I am so pumped!
- Surface time!

147
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,982
Oh, this is gonna be epic!

148
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:16,463
Look both ways before
crossing the street!

149
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,106
It's so beautiful.

150
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:54,105
The city is just
full of possibility.

151
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:57,092
There could be an adventure
around this corner...

152
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,451
Or... or this one...

153
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:01,162
Or this one!

154
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,310
There's not, but there could be!

155
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:08,887
Look at all the computers!

156
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:12,132
Is that the next generation
cadmium processor

157
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,469
with quantum encryption?

158
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,379
I don't know, Donatello. Is it?

159
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,119
- It is!
- Guys, guys!

160
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,490
Check this out.

161
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:21,464
A hand made out of light.

162
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:23,504
Now it's an eye
made out of light.

163
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,244
And the hand again!

164
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:26,983
Now the eye's back!
Now the hand!

165
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,391
- Come on, genius.
- The eye!

166
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:31,267
So where to next?

167
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:35,948
Huh?

168
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:40,495
Ah!

169
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:44,811
That was kinda fun.

170
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:47,922
We're too exposed out here.

171
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:48,923
Come on.

172
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:56,617
Pizza.

173
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,629
Should we open it?

174
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,508
Careful! It could be dangerous.

175
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:09,363
I think it's food.

176
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,470
It's not like any
food I ever saw.

177
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,278
I'll try it.

178
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,149
Mm! Mm.

179
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,911
Uh, yuck.

180
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:35,185
You guys won't like it.
I'll take the rest.

181
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,357
- No way!
- Nuh-uh!

182
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,999
Back off!

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
I never thought I'd
taste anything better

184
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,979
than worms and algae,
but this is amazing!

185
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
Right?

186
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:47,396
I love it up here!

187
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,783
Yeah-ha!

188
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:54,784
Whoohoo!

189
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,267
Ha, ha-ha!

190
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:02,215
Yippy! Ha ha!

191
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:17,063
All right, guys,
it's getting late.

192
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,503
We should probably
head back home.

193
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,676
Lame.

194
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:22,852
Guys! Look at that!

195
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:40,645
She's the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

196
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:44,626
Isn't she the only
girl you've ever seen?

197
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:46,133
My point still stands.

198
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,281
What?

199
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:56,669
What is this?

200
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:01,082
We gotta save 'em!

201
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,026
Splinter's instructions
were very clear.

202
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:06,768
We're supposed to stay
away from people.

203
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:08,240
And bathrooms.

204
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:09,980
I thought you wanted
to be a hero.

205
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:12,053
Since when do heroes
ask for permission?

206
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,225
They don't. But...

207
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,571
Well, I'm going!

208
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,456
Help!

209
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,197
Help!

210
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:27,007
Hey!

211
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,799
Still standing, huh?
I'll fix that.

212
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,903
- Wah!
- Oh!

213
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:38,915
<i>- Watch it!
- You watch it!</i>

214
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:45,002
Watch it, Donnie!

215
00:13:58,014 --> 00:13:59,453
Hyah!

216
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,697
What the... Ah!

217
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,332
Oh, come on!

218
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,804
Ooh!

219
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:16,077
Oh! Ow!

220
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,885
Ha.

221
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:19,886
Ha.

222
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:26,109
Hey, cut it out! Stop! Ow!

223
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,451
Huh? Agh!

224
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,452
Gotcha!

225
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:33,769
Aghh!

226
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,107
No, no, no. No. Don't worry.

227
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,346
We're the good guys.

228
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:38,421
It's okay.

229
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:48,821
Whoops! Sorry.

230
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,429
Watch out!

231
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:54,374
Huh?

232
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,782
They're getting away!
They got the girl!

233
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,889
You just jabbed me
with your sword.

234
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,290
Well, I didn't know you were
gonna land where I was stabbing.

235
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:08,958
You think you're tough, huh?

236
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,831
You think you're tough
enough to stand up

237
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:13,609
to my hot nunchuck fury?

238
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:18,927
Hyah! Wah!

239
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:24,880
Huh?

240
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:27,956
I see. Well, then...

241
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,129
Aah!

242
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,478
Stay back!

243
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:49,396
What the...

244
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:56,724
That is all kinds of wrong.

245
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,137
Aah!

246
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,807
Guys! Guys! You're never
gonna believe this!

247
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:22,817
That dude, he... he...
Had a brain!

248
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:25,594
We all have brains, Mikey.

249
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:27,099
Not all of us.

250
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,171
In our chests?

251
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:30,946
No, Mikey. Not in our chests.

252
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:34,458
You're not listening to me!

253
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,663
Did you just slap me?

254
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:37,736
I was calming you down.

255
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:39,508
Why would that calm me down?

256
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:41,282
I think he's delusional.

257
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:44,158
Just-just... come here.
I'm telling you.

258
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,563
The big guy was a robot

259
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:48,306
and he had a freaky-weird alien
brain thing in his chest.

260
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,745
You gotta believe me.

261
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:52,588
- I'm not sure we do.
- Oh, yeah?

262
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,534
Well, you'll change your tune
when you see that he's...

263
00:16:56,535 --> 00:16:58,744
Gone?

264
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:08,041
And so your inability
to work together

265
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,714
allowed them all to get away.

266
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:11,355
Well, maybe if I didn't
have to waste time

267
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,861
arguing with hero boy,
I could've saved them.

268
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:15,434
Hey, if you hadn't
gotten in my way,

269
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,771
I could have done it.

270
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:18,612
And you went flying
off on your own.

271
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:19,949
How smart was that?

272
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,352
Well, it would've
worked out great

273
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:23,027
if somebody hadn't
hit me in the head

274
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:24,564
with their nunchucks!

275
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:27,809
Well, none of this
would've happened if...

276
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:33,061
Somebody hadn't trusted us to
go up there in the first place.

277
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:34,934
Oh, geez.

278
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:36,473
Sensei, I didn't mean to...

279
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:39,516
- No, Michelangelo.
- You are right.

280
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,423
- I am?
- He is?

281
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:44,233
You were not fully prepared
for what was up there.

282
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,540
I trained you to fight
as individuals,

283
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,213
not as a team.

284
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,654
And as your teacher,
your father,

285
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:53,197
the responsibility
for that is mine.

286
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:56,241
Perhaps in another
year we can try again.

287
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,081
Another year?

288
00:17:58,082 --> 00:18:01,559
Ha! Has everybody forgotten
that people were kidnapped?

289
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,265
They don't have a year!

290
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:06,844
Sensei, we have to
do something now!

291
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,717
You weren't there, sensei.

292
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:11,326
You didn't see the way that
girl looked into my eyes.

293
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,698
She was scared.

294
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:16,045
And she was counting on me...
us... to save her!

295
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:33,537
Yes, you must save her.

296
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,075
I agree, sensei.

297
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:36,347
But in that fight,

298
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,855
we weren't exactly a
well-oiled machine.

299
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,197
Like that robot with
the brain thingy.

300
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:42,434
Give a rest!

301
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:43,437
Hmm.

302
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,953
If you are to fight more
effectively as a unit,

303
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:49,726
you are going to need a leader.

304
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,632
Can I be the leader?

305
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,970
Why should you be the leader?

306
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,675
I kicked your butt. I
should be the leader.

307
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,556
Hey, I'm smarter than all
you guys put together.

308
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,322
- It should be me.
- No way!

309
00:18:58,323 --> 00:19:00,664
<i>It should be me!</i>

310
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:04,142
I don't really have a reason. I
just think it would be neat.

311
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,617
This is a difficult decision.

312
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:09,762
I will meditate on it.

313
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:12,170
It's Leonardo.

314
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:14,146
No hard feelings, Raph?

315
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,795
Stick it in your shell.

316
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,084
Explain to me one more time
what we're doing here.

317
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:28,660
Mikey, we've been over this.

318
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:32,106
That building has the same
logo as the van that was used

319
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:33,344
to kidnap the family.

320
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,417
So if we wait here long enough,

321
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:38,360
one of the kidnappers will
eventually show his face.

322
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:40,401
And when he does, we'll
make him tell us

323
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:41,773
where they took them.

324
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:44,248
And then we got ourselves a van!

325
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,987
Just hit the guy I tell you to.

326
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:47,626
Will do!

327
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:49,534
Are you sure this is gonna work?

328
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:52,611
Trust me. They'll
be here any second.

329
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:57,459
Oh!

330
00:20:02,312 --> 00:20:05,554
Okay, I'm thinking
of something green.

331
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:06,555
Ga-reen. Ga-reen.

332
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,107
Is it Raphael again?

333
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,484
Man, you're good at this!

334
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,443
Give it up already. The
guy's not gonna show.

335
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:22,915
We have to be patient.

336
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,691
No, you have to come
up with a better plan,

337
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,094
'cause the four of
us standing here

338
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,535
with our thumbs up our noses...

339
00:20:28,536 --> 00:20:31,009
I don't think they'd fit.

340
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,347
Is pointless.

341
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:34,221
You sure about that, Raph?

342
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:36,762
He just showed up, didn't he?

343
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:39,974
I should've complained
two hours ago.

344
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:43,385
Gentlemen, I have a
bold and daring plan.

345
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:45,392
There's no time for hesitation.

346
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:49,406
My orders must be carried
out without question.

347
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:51,282
Guys? Guys, wait up!

348
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,273
All right, buddy.

349
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:01,247
We can do this the easy way,

350
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:05,026
or... my vote... the hard way.

351
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,900
Yeah, look at it logically.

352
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,074
There are four of
us and one of you.

353
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:12,051
What are you gonna do?

354
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:15,864
- Yow!
- Whoa!

355
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:18,776
You had to ask!

356
00:21:22,054 --> 00:21:24,997
- He's getting away again!
- No, he's not.

357
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,757
Whoa!

358
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:42,525
Ugh.

359
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,907
Now we're getting somewhere.

360
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:25,471
I don't know what that means.

361
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:27,144
Go around back.

362
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,651
Why didn't he just say so?

363
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:39,388
