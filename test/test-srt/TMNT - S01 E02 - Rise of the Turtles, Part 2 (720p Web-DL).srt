1
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,609
So that's the...

2
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,350
Mutagen that turned us all
into what we are now.

3
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:51,588
Let's drink some!

4
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:53,861
What? Why would you do that?

5
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:58,208
'Cause if you mutate a mutant,
you get a super mutant!

6
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,079
Or a pile of goo
on the sidewalk.

7
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,386
Either way, it's an improvement.

8
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,625
Guys, this is huge.

9
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,934
Whoever kidnapped those
people are somehow connected

10
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:08,039
to what happened to
us 15 years ago.

11
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,511
How is that possible?

12
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:12,720
For alien robots,
anything is possible.

13
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:13,858
Stop that.

14
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,098
There are no such thing
as alien robots!

15
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,037
Oh, yeah?

16
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,977
Well, if there's no such thing

17
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:23,254
as alien robots, how
do you explain this?

18
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:26,096
Aah! Aah! My face!

19
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:29,106
Man, this mask is
glued on tight!

20
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,279
Mikey, stop! It's not a mask.

21
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,589
Okay. He's in the clear.

22
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,930
But those other guys were
totally alien robots.

23
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,638
Enough! Time to
get some answers.

24
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,979
Who are you, and
what's goin' on?

25
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,921
Name's snake, and I
got nothing to say

26
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:46,627
to you hideous freaks.

27
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:49,704
Oh, well, that's 'cause
you don't know us yet.

28
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:50,705
Ah!

29
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:54,720
See, we were just regular guys

30
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:57,997
until we got hit with
a little of this.

31
00:02:57,998 --> 00:02:59,501
Whawhat are you doing?

32
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:01,742
Playing a little
game I like to call.

33
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,113
Mutation Roulette.

34
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:05,386
Now you could turn out
handsome like me,

35
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:06,991
or you might end up

36
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:09,900
disgusting and deformed,
like Mikey here.

37
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:10,871
Hey!

38
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:15,253
So, you feel lucky?

39
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:24,112
Okay, okay!

40
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:26,318
They call themselves the kraang.

41
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,661
They been grabbing scientists
from all over the city.

42
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:34,678
I'm right here.

43
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,685
What do they want
with scientists?

44
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:38,492
I don't know.

45
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,102
All I know is
they're taking them

46
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:44,409
out of the city tonight,
but I don't know where!

47
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,317
This is awesome! That
girl's dad is a scientist.

48
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:48,923
I'm a scientist.

49
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,096
She is so gonna like me.

50
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,738
I don't think you're her type.

51
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,244
Where are they now?

52
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,651
There's gotta be, like,
20 of them down there.

53
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:11,260
Yeah, and that's just
the ones we can see.

54
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:14,871
All right! An
all-you-can-beat buffet!

55
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:18,114
We can't just rush in there.
We need a plan.

56
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,689
- Why?
- Think, you shellbrain.

57
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,262
There are innocent
lives at stake.

58
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,368
If we screw this up,
they're all goners.

59
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,708
Then we won't screw it up.

60
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:30,221
Boy, I could sure go for some
of that pizza right now, huh?

61
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:33,597
What?

62
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:35,136
I can't be the only
one that's hungry.

63
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:37,745
Where's snake?

64
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:41,323
Oh, geez.

65
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,901
Get him!

66
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:59,746
- Maybe he went over the wall.
- I'm on it!

67
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:01,150
Alley-oop!

68
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:03,058
Uhh! Ah! Ugh! Aah!

69
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,006
Ow. I don't think
he went this way.

70
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:25,058
Oh, great. We let him get away.

71
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,831
Whoa, whoa. You're the leader.

72
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:28,837
That means you let him get away.

73
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:31,144
- You're not helping.
- I'm not trying to help.

74
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,020
Okay, okay. You want me to lead?
Fine.

75
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,959
We go back to the lair, gear up,

76
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,867
and at midnight, we
drive snake's van

77
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:39,337
right up to the gate.

78
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,612
They'll think we're him,
and we'll cruise right in.

79
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:43,349
And then we bust some heads?

80
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,326
And then we bust some heads.

81
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:49,604
I love a happy ending.

82
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:06,890
I know you're a little
worried about me.

83
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,461
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

84
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:10,135
We've never gone into
a fight like this,

85
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,909
and I don't know
what's gonna happen.

86
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,782
But you don't have to worry.

87
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,122
I will make it back.

88
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:19,030
I love you, man.

89
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,141
Aww.

90
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:24,680
Are you talking to
your pet turtle?

91
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,719
No. Shut up!

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,959
That's adorable.

93
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,098
Oh, I'm gonna crush you!

94
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,266
Aah!

95
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:34,510
I'm gonna shellac you!

96
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:37,352
I think this plan is gonna work.

97
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,562
No plan ever survives
contact with the enemy.

98
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,602
It is how you react
to the unexpected

99
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,377
that will determine if you
and your brothers succeed.

100
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:48,654
Sensei, do you think
I'm ready for this?

101
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:52,032
Leonardo, I made you
leader for a reason.

102
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,770
What is that reason?

103
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:56,312
That is for you to
discover on your own.

104
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:58,653
There's so much riding on this.

105
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:00,058
What if something goes wrong?

106
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:01,763
Failure is a possibility

107
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:04,437
every leader must
face, Leonardo.

108
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:07,046
It is something I had
to face in Japan

109
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:11,459
during my final battle with
my enemy, the shredder.

110
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,840
Years ago, oroku saki, as
shredder was called then,

111
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:19,585
had been my friend, but
the love of a woman

112
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:21,826
came between us.

113
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:25,538
He could not accept it, and
his jealousy turned outward

114
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:29,081
in a vengeful attack.

115
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,489
And while he could not
defeat me that day,

116
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,934
my world fell and
crumbled around me

117
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:39,347
as the battle took the life
of my beloved tang shen,

118
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:42,927
and I lost my baby
daughter, miwa.

119
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:50,717
But that's my point, sensei.
You lost everything.

120
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:52,789
I lost many things.

121
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,971
My family, my home, my name.

122
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:02,420
But I gained many things as
well, like the four of you.

123
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:04,696
Don't worry. We can handle this.

124
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:08,775
Get back here!

125
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,844
Hey, you can't keep
us in here like this!

126
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,116
We know our rights!

127
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,957
I don't think they care
about that, April.

128
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,463
We can't just sit here.

129
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:22,967
We've gotta do something.

130
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,144
Like what?

131
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:29,856
Oh, my stomach!

132
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,997
The pain is unbearable!

133
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:49,883
Ah!

134
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:58,246
Well, I guess we
can just sit here.

135
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:03,628
They'll be here any minute.

136
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,768
Kraang, are those who are coming

137
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,209
to this place coming
to this place?

138
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,148
I lack that knowledge, Kraang.

139
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,893
I will inquire of Kraang
about that knowledge.

140
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,332
Do you have the knowledge

141
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:19,378
if those coming to this place
are near this place, Kraang?

142
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:21,685
They're turtles!

143
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,597
Call them turtles! "Are
the turtles here?"

144
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,539
There are lights of a
vehicle which contain that

145
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,181
which you wish us
to call the turtles

146
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:34,491
coming to this place which
you wish us to call here.

147
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:37,837
What are you talking about?

148
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:02,278
Ah! Ah!

149
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:23,613
The ones coming to this place
are not in the vehicle

150
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:25,519
bringing them to this place.

151
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,765
Then in what place are the
ones called the turtles?

152
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:36,219
Wow, lucky thing that van
showed up to distract them.

153
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,220
Ow!

154
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:39,964
That was the plan, Mikey.

155
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:41,670
We knew snake was
hiding in the alley,

156
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,579
so Raph and I made him think
we would be in the van.

157
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,053
But we weren't in the van.

158
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:49,695
Just keep climbing.

159
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:51,670
Can do.

160
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:17,182
Wow, I've never seen
anything like this.

161
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:20,424
They're using a metal alloy
that I don't even recognize.

162
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:24,036
Gosh! A metal alloy even
you don't know about!

163
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:25,708
It boggles the mind.

164
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,450
Dude, you wanna talk
metallurgy with me?

165
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,223
- Bring it.
- I don't, and...

166
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:33,499
Guys! What part of
being in an enemy lair

167
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,778
do you not understand?

168
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,854
Whoa. Alien robots.

169
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:52,726
Alien robots, huh?

170
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:55,167
Hmm, where have I
heard that before?

171
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:56,203
Oh, yeah!

172
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:58,847
I've been saying it for hours!

173
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,224
Whoo!

174
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,052
Hwaah!

175
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:42,817
See? See? It's a brain thing!

176
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:44,857
I told you! I told you!

177
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:47,465
But did any of you believe me?
No!

178
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,874
'Cause you all think I'm
just some kind of bonehead!

179
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:52,413
Ow!

180
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:57,131
Uh! Ugh! Ah! Ah!

181
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:04,684
Mikey!

182
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:07,662
Okay!

183
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,435
But I was still right
about the brain thing.

184
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:13,045
You gotta give me that.

185
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:14,349
Let's move.

186
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,092
Move where?

187
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:19,699
I think those are
power conduits.

188
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,709
Oh! That's really interesting!
Thanks for sharing, Donnie.

189
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,685
Meathead, the conduits are
all converging that way,

190
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:28,026
which means that whatever is
going on in that direction

191
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,591
is important!

192
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,850
You got spanked.

193
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:39,428
Ow! Ow! Mercy!

194
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,169
Not cool.

195
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,629
We found 'em!

196
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,046
We'll hold them off!
You pick the lock.

197
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,426
Don't worry! I'll have you
out of there in a second.

198
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:02,467
Okay, giant lizard-thing.

199
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,941
A turtle, actually. I'm...
I'm Donatello.

200
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:07,784
- April.
- Wow, that's a pretty...

201
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:10,359
The lock, Donnie!

202
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,367
Yeahoh, right, yeah! Sorry.

203
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:17,149
Aaaaah!

204
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:22,898
Not to rush you, but hurry up!

205
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,201
Hey! You think it's easy

206
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:26,109
trying to pick a lock
with these hands?

207
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,282
Uh, sorry.

208
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:31,060
Oh, for the love of...
get out of my way!

209
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,203
Ah!

210
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:37,044
What?

211
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:39,482
No!

212
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,726
Huh?

213
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:45,604
Get the door!

214
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:46,607
Huh?

215
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,547
That'll hold 'em.

216
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:00,550
What?

217
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,526
You are seriously twisted.

218
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,236
- Thanks.
- No! Let me go!

219
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,948
Let's get 'em!

220
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:21,915
Uh-oh.

221
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,604
You did this to me!

222
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,745
Now you're going to pay!

223
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:35,049
It's Snake!

224
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,361
He mutated into a... Giant weed!

225
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,315
That's weird.

226
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:48,390
You'd think he'd get
mutated into a snake.

227
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,966
Yeah, you would, if
you were an idiot.

228
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,072
But his name is Snake.

229
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:55,917
- So?
- You don't understand science.

230
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:02,436
I'll crush you turtles!

231
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:04,912
Uh, would it help if we
said it was an accident?

232
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:11,900
So, heh, I'll put
you down for a no?

233
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,676
Whoa!

234
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:21,026
Eww! Eww! Don't let it touch me!

235
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,732
Don't let it touch me!

236
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,305
Aah! It touched me!

237
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:27,949
Ahh.

238
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,393
It grew back?

239
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:32,766
No fair!

240
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:39,219
Donnie! Go!

241
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,235
Ah!

242
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,661
Oh!

243
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:07,208
And... Yuck.

244
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:20,848
Whoa! Aah!

245
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,392
Snakeweed is really powerful!

246
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,265
- Snakeweed?
- Yeah!

247
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:28,907
His name was Snake, and
now he's a weed, so...

248
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:30,278
We get it!

249
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,420
We just have to hold it off
until Donnie gets back.

250
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:37,868
While not getting
shot by alien robots.

251
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:40,813
- With brains!
- Let it go, man.

252
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:50,843
Huh?

253
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:24,481
What's the plan again, chief?

254
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:27,190
I'm working on it.

255
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,444
Whoa!

256
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,507
The power conduits.

257
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:36,118
Are we really gonna start
talking about that again?

258
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,197
Perfect. Raph! Mikey!

259
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,405
Oh, good!

260
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:55,883
For a second there, I thought
this was gonna be too easy!

261
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:08,087
Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

262
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,332
Hold on! I'm coming!

263
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,335
Aah!

264
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:23,534
You okay?

265
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:24,537
Dad.

266
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:40,222
- Aah!
- Whoa!

267
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:47,375
What are they doing?

268
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:51,120
They're leading him straight
toward that power generator!

269
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:53,294
That's incredibly stupid!

270
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:56,270
Or brilliant. Or... or both!

271
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:57,271
Aah! Ow!

272
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:01,455
Hey, come and get me, stinkweed!

273
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:28,672
Kraang, the ones in this
place are not in this place

274
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:29,876
where they were.

275
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:32,517
The ones are called
turtles, Kraang.

276
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:34,624
They are dangerous
to what we are doing

277
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,500
in this place and other places.

278
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,141
Yes, I am knowledge of that.

279
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:45,326
The turtles must be
eliminated from all places.

280
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:08,833
Are you gonna be all right?

281
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,269
I guess.

282
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,741
My aunt says I can stay here

283
00:21:11,742 --> 00:21:13,713
as long as I want,

284
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:15,051
but I'll be a lot better

285
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:17,458
when I track down the
creeps that took my dad.

286
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:20,335
- Won't the police help?
- Funny thing.

287
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:23,110
When you tell them your dad
was kidnapped by alien brains

288
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:27,089
in robot bodies, they don't
take you all that seriously.

289
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,794
I hear that.

290
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:31,402
April, I promise you
we will not rest

291
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:32,574
until we find him.

292
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:35,783
- We won't?
- No, we won't.

293
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:39,127
Thank you, but it's
not your fight.

294
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:41,068
Yes, it is.

295
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,899
I am impressed, Leonardo.

296
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,573
You proved to be an
effective leader

297
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:17,180
under the most difficult
of circumstances.

298
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:18,585
Thank you, sensei.

299
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:21,159
And I think I figured out
why you made me leader.

300
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,998
Oh? Why is that?

301
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,940
Because you sensed inside
me a true warrior's spirit

302
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:27,847
that could forge us
all into the heroes

303
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,619
we are destined to become.

304
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,726
- No.
- No?

305
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,230
Then why did you make me leader?

306
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:35,805
Because you asked.

307
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:37,778
That's it?

308
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:40,152
But you seemed so
certain you were right.

309
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:41,624
As a leader, you will learn

310
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,429
that there is no
right and wrong,

311
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,867
only choices.

312
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:47,676
So you could have
chosen any of us?

313
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:49,816
- Yes.
- Even Mikey?

314
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:50,817
No.

315
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:53,795
- That would have been wrong.
- Everybody!

316
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:56,537
Come here! We made the news!

317
00:22:56,538 --> 00:23:01,085
A report of... get this...
ninjas in New York.

318
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:02,255
Don't believe me?

319
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,662
After residents
reported a disturbance,

320
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,904
the police recovered this.

321
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:11,250
For channel six news, this is.

322
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:13,691
- Carlos Chang O'Brien...
- Gambe

323
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,129
saying, "Hi-ya!"

324
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,569
This is awesome!

325
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,142
We're gonna be famous!

326
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:21,348
You must be more careful.

327
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:24,291
The ninja's most powerful
weapon is the shadows.

328
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:27,133
Being brought out into the
light is a dangerous thing.

329
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:30,242
Relax, sensei. It's one
little news story.

330
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:34,690
What's the worst
that can happen?

331
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:36,763
Ninjas in New York.

332
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:37,935
Don't believe me?

333
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:40,274
After residents
reported a disturbance,

334
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,282
the police recovered this.

335
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,894
Recovered this.

336
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:52,947
So my old enemy is in New York,

337
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:55,355
and training his own army.

338
00:23:55,356 --> 00:24:00,437
At last, I can finish what
I started so long ago.

339
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,981
Prepare my jet.

340
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,612
I'm going to visit
an old friend.
